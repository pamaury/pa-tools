Introduction
============

This directory contains the necessary files to register two
drivers to the DKMS system:
- dummy_hcd: this is a Host+UDC driver to ease usb gadget
  development, it is also useful to fake a usb device on a
  host
- gadgetfs: a file system to build userspace usb gadget drivers

Since both drivers are hardly ever compiled in stock kernels
except on embedded targets, the only option is to recompile the
kernel or build the modules. This approach uses DKMS to download
the source code from the Linus tree (using GitHub mirror)
and build the two modules. The advantage is that once it is
registered, it will automatically rebuilt on each kernel update.

Installation
============

First copy all the files into /usr/src/usb_gadgetfs_devel-1.0/

To register the driver with DKMS, run as root:
dkms add -m usb_gadgetfs_devel -v 1.0

To build the driver with DKMS, run as root:
dkms build -m usb_gadgetfs_devel -v 1.0

To install the driver with DKMS, run as root:
dkms install -m usb_gadgetfs_devel -v 1.0

NOTE: to build the driver, you'll need at least the kernel headers
and the kernel development tools, and dkms obviously

Troubleshooting
===============

Currently it only works for kernels >=3.17 because the layout of
the gadget drivers changed. Once I have time, I'll fix the prebuild
script to differentiate between version <3.16 and >= 3.17
